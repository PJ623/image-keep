# Image Keep

Image Keep is a web application that fetches images from the web and stores those images into browser memory. Currently, Image Keep uses [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to access CORS-restricted images.


Image Keep allows users to quickly save images for offline viewing without the user having to save the images onto their device.
