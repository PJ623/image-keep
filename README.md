# Image Keep

Image Keep is a web application that fetches images from the web and stores those images into browser memory. Currently, Image Keep uses [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to fetch images that are not accessible using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).


Image Keep allows users to quickly save images for offline viewing without the user having to save the images onto their device.


Image Keep is meant to be saved in local storage so that it can be used offline, but you can access the online version of Image Keep [here](https://pj623.github.io/image-keep/).
